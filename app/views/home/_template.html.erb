                    <h4>Employment Contract Template</h4>
                    <p>The purpose of an employment contract is to:</p>
                    <p>
                        • Have a written, detailed description of the job. It includes for example, the maximum number of hours of work per week, wage rate and whether overtime will be paid. The contract must be signed by both the employer and employee.<br>
                        • Describe the terms and conditions of employment.<br>
                        • Articulate the employer's responsibilities and the worker's rights.<br>
                        • Help ensure that the worker gets fair working arrangements.<br>
                        The employment contract must respect provincial labour laws that establish minimum employment standards such as the minimum wage.<br>
                        <b>Enforcing the terms and conditions of the employment contract</b><br>
                        The Government of Canada is not a party to the contract. Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)/Service Canada has no authority to intervene in the employer-employee relationship or to enforce the terms and conditions of employment. It is the responsibility of the employer and worker to familiarize themselves with laws that apply to them and to look after their own interests.<br>
                        The contract assists ESDC/Service Canada officers in forming their Labour Market Impact Assessment, pursuant to their role under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.<br>
                        <b>Sample Employment Contract</b><br>
                        <b>Employers must complete and sign a contract before applying for a Labour Market Impact Assessment.</b><br>
                        The attached sample contract or another contract which includes all the terms and conditions of the sample contract or described in the guidelines for employers, must be completed and signed by the employer. Additional provisions may be added as long as they do not contradict the terms and conditions mentioned above. The employer must complete and sign the employment contract and send it to the foreign worker ("The Employee") with a copy of the confirmation letter he/she received from ESDC. The worker must sign the contract and provide both documents to the Canada mission abroad.<br>
                        <b>Third-party Representatives</b><br>
                        A third-party representative/recruiter cannot be party to or sign the employment contract on behalf of the employer or otherwise.<br>
                        Any agreement respecting employment validations between ESDC/Service Canada and the employer is contingent on the employer being a party to the contract.<br>
                        <b>The contract must comply with provincial labor laws and standards.</b><br>
